# Introducing Pokémon Uhuru: Alpha Build & Ishara's Experts

Exciting news! I'm thrilled to announce the working title for my African-inspired Pokémon fan game: **Pokémon Uhuru**! Development is progressing well, and I'm preparing an **alpha version** for release soon.

## What's in the Alpha?

This alpha build will focus on the core narrative and exploration experience within the **Ishara region**. It will include:

*   **The Full Regional Map:** Explore the diverse landscapes of Ishara.
*   **Act I Story Outline:** Experience the beginning of the journey, meet key characters, and uncover the initial seeds of conflict involving the Discovery Guild.
*   **Curated Pokémon Selection:** While the full roster of custom Fakemon is still under development, the alpha will feature a carefully selected group of existing Pokémon to populate the region and provide a balanced gameplay experience.

This alpha version is a crucial step to gather feedback on the story, pacing, map design, and overall feel of Pokémon Uhuru before we move into developing the unique creatures that will truly define the Ishara region.

## Plot Sneak Peek: The Professors' Role

The story of Pokémon Uhuru begins in the serene village of `Kijiji Chema`. Here, you'll meet the your neighbor, Nkoola and the first of Ishara's esteemed Pokémon Professors:

### Professor Acacia: The Guide
Based in the town of **Ashira**, Professor Acacia specializes in **Human-Pokemon Studies**. She provides the player with their starter Pokémon and entrusts them with the vital task of completing an ecological survey via the Pokédex. Her guidance emphasizes understanding and respecting the natural heritage of Ishara. She also introduces early game mechanics, like using Pokémon moves in the overworld to interact with the environment, such as making it rain to cross a dried riverbed.

### Professor Blackwood: The Historian
As you journey beyond `Ashira`, you'll encounter Professor Blackwood near the **Olduvai Research Site**. A specialist in **Paleoanthropology**, he's uncovering secrets of Ishara's ancient peoples. His research provides crucial lore, but he also warns of recent trespassers disrupting the historical sites – your first hints of the antagonistic Discovery Guild and their interest in Ishara's past and resources.

### Professor Mangrove: The Marine Expert
Further exploration leads you to the coast and Professor Mangrove's research station in **Mzizima**. Specializing in **Marine Pokeonomy**, he studies the rich aquatic life and nearby island ecosystems. Professor Mangrove shares legends of a powerful, ancient sea-faring civilization connected to the islands and the `Edono Crater`, hinting at the deeper mysteries and Legendary Pokémon tied to Ishara's land and sea. His research often involves navigating treacherous waters and exploring island ruins filled with puzzles.

These three professors are central figures in Pokémon Uhuru. Their combined research is key to understanding the threats facing the Ishara region and the underlying legends that shape its destiny. They guide the player not just physically through the region, but also intellectually, revealing the importance of ecology, history, and cultural understanding.
