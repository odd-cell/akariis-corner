# Welcome to my Game Development Journey

Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to welcome you to Akarii's Corner, a space where I'll be sharing my journey through game development, art creation, and content design. As someone deeply passionate about creating immersive experiences, I believe in the power of games to tell stories, challenge perspectives, and bring people together. This blog will serve as both a development diary and a platform to share insights, challenges, and discoveries along the way.

Currently, I'm working on an exciting project called "Untitled Rogue-like," a unique blend of roguelike mechanics and library management. The game puts you in the role of a librarian in a magical world where books serve as portals to different realms. Each run through the procedurally generated dungeons not only challenges your combat and strategic skills but also helps you collect resources to expand and improve your library. I chose this concept because it combines my love for both traditional roguelike gameplay and cozy management mechanics, creating something that I hope will appeal to a diverse range of players.

Looking ahead, my development goals extend beyond just creating games – I want to build experiences that resonate with players on multiple levels. This means focusing on accessibility, inclusive design, and meaningful storytelling. I'm particularly interested in exploring how game mechanics can be used to tell stories that might otherwise go untold, and how we can make games more welcoming to players from all backgrounds. Through this blog, I'll be sharing detailed insights into my development process, including technical tutorials, design decisions, and the occasional deep dive into specific features or challenges.

I invite you to join me on this journey of creation and discovery. Whether you're a fellow developer, an aspiring game creator, or simply someone interested in the process of game development, I hope you'll find value in the content I share here. You can expect regular updates about my projects, technical tutorials, design discussions, and behind-the-scenes looks at the development process. I also welcome your feedback and questions – after all, game development is as much about community as it is about coding and creativity.

Feel free to explore my current projects on the [games page](/games), where you can find more detailed information about "Untitled Rogue-like" and other upcoming projects. You can also connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/odd-cell) for more frequent updates and discussions. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
