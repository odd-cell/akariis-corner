# Introducing Obsidian: A Magical Library Adventure

I'm thrilled to announce my latest project, **Obsidian** - an epic adventure that combines the thrill of action RPG combat with the cozy charm of library management. In this unique game, you'll help Anubis rebuild the Great Library while exploring magical worlds within enchanted books.

## The Concept

Imagine a world where books are more than just stories - they're portals to magical realms. As the chosen librarian, you'll dive into these enchanted pages, facing themed enemies, solving puzzles, and collecting resources to rebuild the Great Library. But it's not all combat and exploration; you'll also get to create your own cozy reading nook, engage in library management activities, and craft magical items.
