# Initial Development Progress

We've made significant progress on the core mechanics of Pixel Platformer. Here's what we've accomplished so far:

## Core Mechanics
- Implemented smooth player movement with variable jump heights
- Added wall sliding and wall jumping mechanics
- Created a basic combat system with melee attacks

## Level Design
- Designed the first tutorial area
- Created modular tile sets for different environments
- Implemented basic platforming challenges

## Next Steps
1. Polish the movement mechanics
2. Add more combat moves
3. Design the first major area
4. Implement basic enemy AI

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue development!
