# **Untitled Pokémon Fan Game**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a fan game inspired by my culture and experiences. My vision is to create a compelling, story-driven monster-catching RPG that captures the essence of Tanzania, Madagascar, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa, DRC, and Zimbabwe. While I'm not an expert on the diverse cultures of these places, my aim is to translate personal experiences from this region into an interactive piece of media that highlights its nuances.

The region is perfect for a Pokémon-inspired story, with its rich cultural heritage, mythology, history, ecology, and geography. Through this project, I hope to honor the vibrant diversity of Africa and offer players an immersive adventure.

## **Development Tools**
To bring this idea to life, I'll use:
- **Engine**: RPG Maker XP with Pokémon Essentials and plugins.
- **Graphics**: Procreate and Photoshop.
- **Coding**: Cursor as an AI-driven scripting tool.
- **Sound Editing**: Soundtrap.

The development process will be broken into phases, with demo versions released for the community to play and provide feedback. I'll document the journey through dev logs on my website and share videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Rednote.

## **Development Phases**
1. **Mapping**: Outlining the game design and project structure.
2. **Prototyping**: Testing game mechanics and assets.
3. **Building**: Assembling maps, scripts, and assets.
4. **Testing & Promotion**: Engaging the community for feedback and generating interest.
5. **Further Development**: Refining based on community input.
6. **Beta Release**: Sharing an early-access version of the game.
7. **Polishing & Full Release**: Final adjustments and launching the complete game.

After the release, I plan to create a Let's Play series that dives into the details of the game, exploring the region's features and storytelling elements.

## **Key Features**
- **Custom Maps**: Unique regions inspired by African landscapes.
- **New Monsters**: Fresh designs that resonate with local flora, fauna, and mythology.
- **Deep Narrative**: A rich, character-driven story.

## **Goals**
The game will include:
- **8 Gyms**
- **16 Cities**
- **3 Safari Zones**
- **7 Towns**
- **7 Dungeons**
- **12 Routes**
- **7 Wonders**

## **Staying True to My Vision**
Throughout this journey, I aim to stay connected to the community and family that inspire me. My goal is to create the best possible Pokémon fan game that reflects the heart of Africa.
